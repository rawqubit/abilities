# CELEBRATION ENGINE
# A background daemon that detects wins and positive moments from
# conversation, then surfaces them at the right time.
#
# Most AI abilities only activate on problems. This one notices
# when things go RIGHT.
#
# Pattern: Background poll → analyze conversation → detect wins →
#          store silently → celebrate at the right moment
